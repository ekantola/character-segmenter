Segment and separate characters in a bitmap image

Simple utility to segment and output separate characters in an image containing text. Expects the characters to be "not much vertically overlapping". There is, however, a configurable maximum expected text lenght that, if exceeded, will cause the algorithm to try harder to separate characters.
